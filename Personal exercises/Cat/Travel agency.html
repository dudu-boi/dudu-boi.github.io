        <h2 id="aboutUs">About Us:</h2>
        <p>Ever felt like your life is a tedious cycle of work, bills, and pretending to enjoy small talk? Fear not! At Dodgy Destinations, we specialise in whisking you away to mysterious (read: suspiciously cheap) locations where you can "find yourself"—or at least lose your wallet in a back alley.</p>

        <h2 id="ourServices">Our Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Budget Breakdowns</strong> – Because who doesn’t love last-minute panic when hidden fees appear?</li>
            <li><strong>Exotic Getaway</strong> – Experience culture by ordering the only dish you recognise on the menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Luxury Travel</strong> – Pay premium prices to sit in an aircraft seat that still barely reclines.</li>
            <li><strong>Mystery Trips</strong> – We pick a place, you pray it has plumbing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
        <p>Because <strong>TripAdvisor</strong> is for cowards. You don’t need reviews—just blind faith and an adventurous stomach. We guarantee an unforgettable experience… mostly because trauma is hard to forget.</p>

        <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>
        <p><em>"I asked for a relaxing beach holiday and ended up hiking through an active volcano. Would book again."</em> – Some bloke named Dave</p>
        <p><em>"Got lost, ran out of money, and had to barter my watch for a sandwich. 10/10 trip."</em> – Emily, possibly still stranded</p>
