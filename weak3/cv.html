        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Lê Hồng Quang — university student by title, visual alchemist by trade. With over two years of experience wrestling pixels and timelines into cinematic submission, I’ve conjured content from the pits of social media chaos to the polite halls of creative side projects. A fast learner, a trend whisperer, and a devout worshipper at the altar of the Almighty Deadline. One mustn’t offend the Deadline. The Deadline sees all.
