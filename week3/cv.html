                Oh, hello there. I suppose you want to know about me. Well, I'm Nathan, but my friends call me "Snarky" (for reasons that will become painfully obvious). 
                I dabble in web development, mostly to avoid doing actual work. If you need someone who can turn coffee into code and sarcasm into solutions, look no further.
